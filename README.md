Hello! My name is Sarah Bateman and I am a graduate student at the University of Utah studying Software Development.

As I work towards the completion of the [rigorous 16-month program](https://msd.utah.edu/), I am looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the workforce. I am a quick learner, ambitous problem solver, and self-motivated in pursuing my own development. As my previous career was in Hospitality Management, I consider teamwork and conflict management some of the unique skills I bring to the market. 

If you would like to learn more about my academic and professional experience, please check out my [resume](https://github.com/SarahBateman22/Portfolio/blob/main/PageInfo/Bateman_Resume.pdf) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-bateman-281711193/)!

I am also available by email at sarahbateman22@gmail.com
